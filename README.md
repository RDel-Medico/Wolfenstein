# Wolfenstein (3D Game engine)

Basic 3D game engine based on the game Wolfenstein

## Description

Here is my attempt of recreating the game engine used by the 90s game Wolfenstein.
That is to say a 3D projection of a 2D grid map.
Only movement has been implemented (no enemies, weapons, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* In order to run the program you will need Open JDK 17 (https://adoptium.net/)

### Installing

Once you have Open JDK 17 you can install the .zip file and extract it.
Then you can choose according to your OS and in capacity of your pc the version you want:

* For Linux :
Choose one of the two file that begin with linux (./Wolfenstein-main/linux-XXX)
* For Windows :
Choose one of the two file that begin with windows (./Wolfenstein-main/windows-XXX)
---
* For low capacity computer :
Choose the file that begin with your OS and end with LQ (./Wolfenstein-main/XXX-amd64_LQ)
* For high capacity computer :
Choose the file that begin with your OS and end with HQ (./Wolfenstein-main/XXX-amd64_HQ)

### Executing program

* To run the program on Linux :
In a terminal go under the version you choosed to run and execute the main (under ./Wolfenstein-main/windows-amd64_[HQ/LQ] execute ./main)
---
* To run the program on Windows :
Go under the version you choosed to run and execute the main.exe (./Wolfenstein-main/windows-amd64_[HQ/LQ]/main.exe)

### Help

* The generation of the map is totally random (maybe i will implement a proper maze generator in a later update), so it's common to be in weird situation when you appear such as being in a 1 by 1 room, don't hesitate to go in the 2D representation (the key to do that is shown on screen).
And reload the programm if you are stuck.
